This project is a modular robotic manipulator mounted to a motorized chassis, designed for planetary surface operations and prototyped for NASA's RASC-AL competition. I developed the full system architecture â€” mechanical, electrical, and software â€” to demonstrate autonomy, communication, and precision motor control across distributed subsystems.

## ðŸ”§ Overview

- **Platform**: Custom 4-wheeled rover chassis  
- **Arm**: 7-DOF modular robotic arm with PID control  
- **Brain**: Raspberry Pi 4 (onboard) hosting Wi-Fi and MQTT broker  
- **Communication**: MQTT over local Wi-Fi â€” robust, scalable, and fast  
- **Control Modes**:  
  - **Position mode**: PID loop to target angle using potentiometer feedback  
  - **Velocity mode**: Direct motor control with acceleration handling  
- **Control Interfaces**: SSH and Xbox controller via MQTT

Each arm joint is modular â€” receiving only **four wires** (HV, LV) â€” and contains its own motor controller, ESP8266 microcontroller, and potentiometer.

## ðŸ›  Mechanical Design

- Structural frame: 1"x1" aluminum extrusion  
- All joints, brackets, and harmonic drives: **3D printed** and custom-designed  
- Arm optimized for modularity, weight, and reach/mobility  
- Joint torque calculated based on load case simulations and lifting specs  
- Gear reductions designed to meet torque and inertia requirements

## âš¡ Electrical Architecture

- **Power**:  
  - 24V input from wall supply  
  - 5V buck regulator powers Raspberry Pi and logic lines  
- **Joint Boards** (Custom PCBs):  
  - ESP8266 (D1 Mini) microcontroller  
  - DRV8871 motor driver  
  - Potentiometer for joint angle feedback  
  - PWM/MQTT-compatible firmware  
- **Minimal wiring**: Only 24V and 5V lines between joints

---

## ðŸ’» Software & Communication

- **MQTT Broker**: Hosted on Raspberry Pi (Mosquitto)  
- **Desired Values** sent in bracket format:  
  ```[DL, DR, J3, J4, J5, J6, G]```  
  - `DL/DR` = Drive train left/right velocity  
  - `J3â€“J6` = `P45.0` (position) or `V-0.6` (velocity)  
  - `G` = Gripper angle (0â€“180)

- **ESP8266 Joint Firmware**:  
  - Parses desired angle from bracket  
  - Switches mode (P/V) dynamically  
  - Runs local PID loop or velocity output  
  - Publishes actual angle back over MQTT

- **Control Options**:
  - SSH terminal (send manual commands)  
  - Xbox controller (via MQTT with mode toggles, LED indicators, deadzones, and analog scaling)

## ðŸ“¡ Live Feedback

Each joint continuously reports actual position in real time:

```plaintext
ðŸŸ¢ DESIRED : ['0.00', '0.00', 'P30.00', 'V-0.50', 'X', 'X', '60']
ðŸ”µ ACTUAL  : ['X', 'X', '29.80', '-86.12', 'X', 'X', '60']
```
